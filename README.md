<h1> System Engineering & Devops </h1>

<p> System engineering is the process of designing and developing a system. It includes the creation of requirements, the development of a system architecture, the design of individual system components, and the integration of those components into a working system. </p>
<p> DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the time it takes to deliver features to customers. DevOps is designed to improve collaboration between developers and operations teams and to automate the process of software delivery. </p>
<p> System engineering and DevOps are two important approaches to software development. System engineering focuses on the design and development of a system, while DevOps focuses on the delivery of software features to customers. Both approaches are important for creating a successful software development process. </p>
